    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Prog 12 - 10589 - Area Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this Prog 12 - 10589 - Area application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Prog 12 - 10589 - Area application.


Prog 12 - 10589 - Area.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Prog 12 - 10589 - Area.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

Prog 12 - 10589 - Area.cpp
    This is the main application source file.
